# OneClickPackage-1.0

Attention!

This program is specifically for lazy people who want to get rid of doing the tedious job of creating several files again and again for making their python packages. It has now been reduced to some form filling and a simple click!
The python package created is also registered and uploaded on PyPi automatically. Save your precious time!

The program currently uses wxPython for creating GUI based functionalities. 
So, you will need to install wxPython for it to work. [Get it from here] (http://www.wxpython.org/download.php).
