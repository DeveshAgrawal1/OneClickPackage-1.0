# OneClickPackage-1.0

Attention!

This program is specifically for lazy people who want to get rid of doing the tedious job of creating several files again and again for making their python packages. It has now been reduced to some form filling and a simple click!

The python package created is also registered and uploaded on PyPi automatically. Save your precious time!


The program supports taking upto 5 keywords you can specify to be included in your python package creation and also upto 5 other python package names which need to be installed before for your package to be installed.



The program currently uses wxPython for creating GUI based functionalities.
